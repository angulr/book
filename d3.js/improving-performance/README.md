# Improving Performance

## Array VS Object

Every element in Array can be stored and retrieved at Index and we can look or map function easily on it.

Object are stored in key value pair. The advantage is we can immediately fetch the value stored inside without searching through entire data set.

Object is useful if we repeatedly need to access the value or every time visualization update.

We can use **`d3.nest`** to convert an Array data into Object or Nested Data.
