# What is OAuth and OIDC

**OAuth 2** provides authorization flows for web, desktop, and mobile devices. It is an authorization framework _**\(Not Authentication\)**_ that enables applications to obtain limited access or information to user accounts on an HTTP service.

**OpenIdConnect \(OIDC\)** is an authentication _**\(Not authorization\)**_ protocol, based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications. It uses simple JSON Web Tokens \(JWT\), which you can obtain using flows conforming to the OAuth 2.0 specifications.
