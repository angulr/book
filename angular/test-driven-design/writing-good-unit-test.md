# Writing Good Unit Test

## Structuring 

* Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs
* Act on the object or class under test
* Assert that the expected results have occurred

## Damp vs DRY

* DRY \(Do not Repeat Yourself\) :- Remove Duplicate
* DAMP :- Repeat yourself if necessary 

## Tell the Story

* A test should be a complete story, all within the it\(\)
* Move less interesting setup into beforeEach\(\)
* Keep critical setup within the it\(\)
* Include Arrange, Act and Assert inside the it\(\)
